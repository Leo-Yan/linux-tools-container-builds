This set of scripts and Dockerfiles have been used to test the Linux
perf tool and the pahole projects on as many distros as are available on
the public container image repositories such as quay, docker hub, etc.

Now I just pruned it a bit and removed as much perf-isms as possible so
that we can use it to test build more tools.

Basic usage:

1) Build the images running, do this from time to time to update the
   base images:

  $ pull_build

2) Create a tarball with the tool source code, for perf that is:

  $ make perf-tarxz-src-pkg
  $ ls -la perf-*.tar.xz
  -rw-r--r--. 1 acme acme 2917628 Mar 18 10:39 perf-6.8.0.tar.xz
  $

3) Make it available for curl/wget to later obtain it, lighttpd being
   a possibility:

 $ sudo cp perf-*.tar.xz /var/www/lighttpd/perf/

4) Specify the tarball URL to be used:

 $ export BUILD_TARBALL=http://192.168.86.5/perf/perf-6.8.0-rc1.tar.xz

5) Run the 'dm' utility to enumerate and run all the build containers:

6) In the failure above more can be found at:

  $ cat dm.log/amazonlinux:2

To build some other project one has to specify which is the build
command after the build tarball, for example for pahole, that has a
buildcmd.sh script in its main directory:

  $ export BUILD_CMD=buildcmd.sh
